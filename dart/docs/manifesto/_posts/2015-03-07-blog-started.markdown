Building [egamebook][] --- the system for writing non-trivial electronic gamebooks --- has been a years-long journey already and I have poured _lots_ of energy, time and thinking into it.

I have built about 10 prototypes, written thousands lines of code in 3 different programming languages, collaborated with 3 amazing people, and put down more than 200 notes and ideas. I have learnt a great deal about interactive fiction, storytelling, game mechanics, API design, user experience, the addictive nature of chance, product development, natural language generation, goal oriented action planning, and much more.

So I'm starting this blog.

You can put it into your RSS reader if you're into that kind of thing (the url is <a href="{{ site.url}}/feed.xml">`{{ site.url}}/feed.xml`</a>), or you can <a href="{{ site.url }}/signup.html">sign up</a> for the mailing list.
