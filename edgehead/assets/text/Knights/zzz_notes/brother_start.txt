ROOM: $brother_start

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
I first realize my brother is a complete idiot when I am 12. He decides to save a single lamb (something of which our family has plenty at the time) by going to a deep, musty forest, armed only with a stick. I, of course, follow him. Because I am also an idiot.

* I am a boy / girl > named ___.

I am also a necromancer. Not that anyone knows this at the time, and not that I am any good yet.

"Stop following me, [Aren]," my brother says.

* "You should not enter the forest alone, Isaac."
* "You're going to get hurt. I cannot miss it."
* "It is one lamb. Let us go home."

Isaac rolls his eyes and turns to continue. That's when we meet the skin man.

// TODO: image

Until that day, Isaac and I have hoped that the tale of the skin man, living in the forest and eating flesh, is one of those stories to keep kids like us out of more ordinary trouble. But no. Skin man — apparently an uncle of hours — is very much real. He is standing in front of us with an axe.

"Flesh eats flesh," he says conversationally, and prepares for an attack.

// FIGHT with uncle - brother is invincible (cannot die). There is a rock / pointy stick I can use. Or maybe I have a small knife. After a few rounds, uncle stops, looks Aren in the eyes, and runs away terrified.

// TODO: next stage - either "character choices", or jump straight to San Francisco
