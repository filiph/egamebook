ROOM: $goblin_skirmish_sneak

POS: 13, 98

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
Suddenly, I hear voices ahead. Two goblins are arguing about something.

DESCRIPTION:
The goblins are still here.

ACTION: $listen_to_them_arguing
COMMAND: Goblins >> Listen
FOR_LOCATION: $goblin_skirmish_sneak

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
"Why not go now?" a goblin says in a screeching voice. "They are weak. It will be an easy take."

"How do you know they are weak?" This other goblin's voice is lower. This tells me he is ranked above the first one. "They can have a platoon of guards."

"Amak was there. He saw no guards!" 

"Amak is a fool, and so are you. The guards can be in the graytower." He means the Pyramid.

"Another reason why not to go there."

ACTION: $observe_goblin_camp
COMMAND: Camp >> Observe
FOR_LOCATION: $goblin_skirmish_sneak

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
[We] find a hiding spot behind a tree stump and gingerly look over it. I see a camp ground with a fire pit and a small shelter made of some animal's hide. There are three goblins, not two. The third goblin is sleeping.  There may be more that I don't see, but looking at the size of the camp ground, it's not likely.

FOR_LOCATION: $goblin_skirmish_sneak

PREREQUISITES:
w.actionHasBeenPerformed("listen_to_them_arguing")

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
The higher ranked goblin takes something out of a leather bag and shoves it into the other's face.

"The only reason we are here, shithead, is the graytower. Look at the device."

The lower ranked goblin's face wrinkles, almost showing his teeth but not quite.

"The kh'ompakh is just a stupid piece of metal. Its maker wants us here, _around_ the graytower. Not _in_ it."

"Oh, you know what the maker wants, do you?" The higher ranked goblin, who I decide is a captain, places the device back in the bag.

ACTION: $listen_more
COMMAND: Goblins >> Continue listening
FOR_LOCATION: $goblin_skirmish_sneak

PREREQUISITES:

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
The two goblins don't speak anymore. They each look into the fire.
