POS: 21, 46

FIRST_MAP_NAME: Damp Place
FIRST_HINT: Corridors around this place smell of stale water. A faint splashing can be heard.

MAP_NAME: Reservoir
HINT: A large, filthy pool in the middle of the building.

FLAGS: $IDLE

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
A large, filthy pool in the middle of the building, surrounded by a ledge and covered with a layer of green sludge. The reservoir was clearly built by the ancients, with their straight lines and craftsmanship of the highest quality. It would have been intended to distribute water to the upper floors, but I wouldn't want to taste what's collected there now. There's an iron dam here, preventing the water from spilling into the corridors of the Pyramid.

Everything is wet, even the ceiling. Condensed water forms drops that land back on the water surface, making a hollow sound in the large room.

Something big just moved in the water.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
A huge empty room, with the floor covered in sludge and slimy carcasses. There are orc and goblin corpses there, too.

Muddy footprints lead away from the reservoir.

ACTION: $reservoir_water_examine
COMMAND: Water >> Observe
FOR_LOCATION: $reservoir
PREREQUISITES:
!c.hasHappened(evOpenedDam)

INK:
I am almost certain there is something moving just below the surface of the water. Something bigger than a fish. But the water is filthy and the room is dark.

* Investigate

  I crouch close to the water, keeping my head low in order to read the surface better. For a long while, nothing happens. In fact, the room seems to get quieter.

  Then, all of a sudden, something human-sized appears only a few feet away, still under the surface, making a large wave moving directly at me. The thing is unnaturally fast in the water.

  * * Jump away

    I leap backwards and the thing in the water immediately changes direction and subsides, until there is no more wave. The reservoir becomes still again.

  * * Keep watching

    The wave comes at me swiftly. Then, a slick reptilian head emerges surprisingly close to where I crouch, and something long and sharp pierces my {chest|neck}.

    It's a clean thrust, and I know then and there I have only a few heartbeats left in me. With sudden clarity, I see the creature leap out of the water, and pull its spear out easily from my body.

* Leave it be

  The sensible thing to do with an unknown, large creature in its element.

ACTION: $reservoir_dam_examine
COMMAND: Dam >> Examine
FOR_LOCATION: $reservoir

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
The low waves of the reservoir go up and down the face of the dam, producing an occasional splash where the dam meets with the solid, reinforced walls. The doors of the dam are almost all rust now, though they were probably white in the ancient times. At least that's what I gather from the small islands of white on the otherwise dark red surface.

The dam is topped with a little bridge. There's an iron wheel here which is connected to the dam beneath with a massive rod.

I lean on the wheel and push hard to the right. To my surprise, the wheel does move a bit but then immediately stops. A faint thud escapes from below.

After laboring over the wheel for some time, I get it to move, but only a bit. It moves maybe an inch and then stops. A faint thud escapes from below.

I shrug and let off the wheel.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I lean on the wheel and push hard to the left. To my surprise, the wheel does move. Before I know it, the wheel turns easily, and the sound of rushing water fills the room.

In only a few moments, the reservoir empties. As it does, I think I can see a creature on the opposite side of the room. It jumps from the fast-subsiding water surface onto a ledge and quickly disappears in shadows. It leaves muddy footprints behind.

PREREQUISITES:
c.hasHappened(evOpenedDam)

INK:
[We] use the same ledge as the creature and follow the muddy footprints. After leaving the reservoir area, the footprints beeline to a tight crawl space out of sight. The creature must be as unwelcome among the orcs as any human.

The footprints continue downward. There is no wandering — the creature must know these parts well.

After a long while, the creature's trail leads me all the way to the enormous hole in the Pyramid and the foliage that fills the space.

NOTES:
- Optional: also allow following the water?

// Vignette

Everything is wet here, even the ceiling. Condensed water forms drops that land back on the water surface, making a hollow sound in the large room.

* Surface of water >> Examine

Something something almost beautiful. <>

* Ceiling >> Examine

Something something kind of nice. <>

Not that this makes the place any less gross.


// NOTES:
This place has a dam that leads to regular corridors.
It was build a long time ago by people with much more skill.
There is evidence that the orcs are using it.
