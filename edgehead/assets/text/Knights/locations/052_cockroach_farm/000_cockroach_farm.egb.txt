ROOM: $cockroach_farm

POS: 30, 48

FIRST_MAP_NAME: Smell of Rot
FIRST_HINT: The closer I am to this area, the more I can smell rotten food and flesh. No voices, though, and no footsteps.

MAP_NAME: Cockroach Farm
HINT: The main source of food for the orcs.


FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
I am in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike. All crawling with cockroaches.

The place smells awful. There is rotten food on the floor for the cockroaches to eat and almost no air movement. I quickly realize this is a sort of a farm. The orcs are letting the cockroaches multiply, feeding them with whatever they’ll eat. There are shovels and chests here, prepared for harvest.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE
