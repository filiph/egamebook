Did I travel all this way, did I go through all this, for nothing? [[IF c.playerHasWoodenFoot]]My left foot starts to itch.

ACTION: $sarn_read_letter
COMMAND: Inventory >> letter from my father >> read to Sarn
FOR_LOCATION: $bleeds_main

PREREQUISITES:
c.hasHappened(evSavedSarn)
&&
c.hasItem(letterFromFatherId)

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
Sarn listens intently. There seems to be a little bit of recognition in his face. By the time I finish reading, he looks happier, though still out of it.


NOTES:

There could be a Sarn >> Kill option if we wanted to be a lot darker. That would end the game? If not, then we'd have to tread carefully, especially around the ending. If we do end the game with killing Sarn, then the "Win" screen must reflect that it's just one of the choices.
