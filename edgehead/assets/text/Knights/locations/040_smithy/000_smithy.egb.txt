He is being guarded by an orc jailer. He's working on a battle axe at the anvil, using some piece of ancient metal equipment as a handle.

IS_IMMEDIATE: $TRUE

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I drop down next to Sarn. He looks surprised but there is no recognition in his eyes.

The orc jailer takes an iron mace and advances towards me.

"Step back, inventor," he says to Sarn. "Let me deal with this worm."

Sarn retreats to a corner of the room and looks at the floor, waiting.

NOTES:

Old AFTER_MONSTERS_CLEARED:

TODO: I try to talk to Sarn, but he doesn't respond. He's trying to keep forging the weapons. "I must do this, the jailer told me to do this." Finally, I snap Sarn out of it, at least to stop forging and follow me.

IF I know jisad: go straight to him, otherwise, we must meet him

"Where are we going?"

* "Safety."
* "Hell."

TODO: I take Sarn (and his hammer) through the Pyramid and outside, where he starts sobbing. I try to be mad at Sarn but instead I just take Sarn to Jisad and leave him there. He'll be safe at Jisad's.

// TODO: what if we haven't met Jisad yet? - quickly introduce and set kbBlindGuide

As I leave the hut, I nod to both men, and Jisad, though blind, seems to notice the nod while Sarn doesn't.

I sigh and turn my back to them, and walk out to The Bleeds. This has not happened the way I imagined it.
