INK:
The apple is one of the Fruits grown on the slopes of the Pyramid. This one is especially large and extremely red.

"You can have it if you want," Oracle says[[IF c.playerHasWoodenFoot]], glancing at the wooden stump I have for a foot[[ENDIF]][[IF c.playerHasAsthma]] while I have a little fit of cough[[ENDIF]]. "You need it more than I do."

* "Is it dangerous?"

  "Only if you do something stupid with all the energy it gives you. The Fruits of the Pyramid are indeed miraculous."

* "Thank you."

  "You're welcome. I have all the energy I need."
