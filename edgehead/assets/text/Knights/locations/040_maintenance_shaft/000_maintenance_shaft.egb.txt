Musty, dark place. Through cracks, I can see rooms under me.

Going to the end of the shaft, I can see [[IF !c.hasHappened(evKarlGuardsKilled)]]two orcs below, guarding some kind of a large gate. A berserker and a captain.[[ELSE]]a room below, with a large gate.[[ENDIF]]

[[IF !c.hasHappened(evKarlKilled)]]A guttural breathing sounds come from beyond the gate.[[ENDIF]]

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
The two are laughing.

"He ate him whole, didn't he?" the orc captain says. "I've never seen Karl do that."

"We should feed him something even bigger next time," the berserker smirks. "A horse, maybe."

"Get a horse carcass up here and we'll do it. The sucker is sleeping like a baby, and I think it's because of the size of the food."

The berserker nods. "Even better, it looks like we don't need to worry about chopping the carcasses from now on."

"Yah. A whole hawkman in one swallow." The captain shakes his head. "Karl is full of surprises, isn't he."
