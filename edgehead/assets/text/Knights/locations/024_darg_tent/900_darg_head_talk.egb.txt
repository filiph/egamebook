INK:
I am almost about to [[IF c.inRoomParent("crowdsource")]]retreat back to the shadows[[ELSE]]leave[[ENDIF]] when I hear a soft, gurgling sound. Darg's head opens its dead eyes, and an ugly, unnatural grin appears on the face.

I am reminded of my fight with Lady Hope. The necromancer is speaking through dead flesh again.

[[THEN]]
I am duly impressed. Someone must be puppeteering the body. A highly skilled necromancer, perhaps.

I risk a quick look around. Nobody else is here. The necromancer must be doing this from afar. Even more impressive.

But then, Darg's undead lips start moving. He _speaks._

"Welcome, young one." The voice is dry and labored, but nevertheless understandable. A talking corpse is something I've never even considered before. This is obviously necromancy of some higher level.

"You should know I hold no grudge against you. I respect your skill."

* "I respect yours."

   "Good," the head says. "You must understand, I seek nothing less than immortality. Not of myself, mind you. Immortality of civilization, of culture."

* "Shut up."

Darg's dead gaze slowly slides toward the floor but the mouth keeps talking. "What happened to the ancients cannot happen to us. I will make sure of it."

The muscles on Darg's head finally loosen and his tongue touches the ground.

I knee down to inspect the dead body. Surely, the necromancer behind the talking must have used some kind of a device to make the corpse talk. He or she could have implanted it into the windpipe a long ago.

But I find no such thing. Despite my instincts, I must assume that the necromancer is able to do all of this remotely, without the help of any device. I shudder. No human can possibly endure such concentration. Such pain.

On Darg's chest, I find a circular iron badge. It has nothing embossed in it, but that simplicity somehow makes it even more impressive. I take it.
