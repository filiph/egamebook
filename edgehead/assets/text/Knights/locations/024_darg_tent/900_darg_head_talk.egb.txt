// TODO: make a variant for when we do this near Darg's tent (i.e. no "shadows")
I am almost about to retreat back to the shadows when I hear a soft, gurgling sound. Darg's head opens its dead eyes, and an ugly, unnatural grin appears on the face.

[[THEN]]
I am duly impressed. Someone must be pupetteering the body. A highly skilled necromancer, perhaps.

I risk a quick look around. Nobody else is here. The necromancer must be doing this from afar. Even more impressive.

But then, Darg's undead lips start moving. He _speaks._

"Welcome, young one." The voice is dry and labored, but nevertheless understandable. A talking corpse is something I've never even considered before. This is obviously necromancy of some higher level.

"You should know I hold no grudge against you. I respect your skill."

* "I respect yours."

* "That is irrelevant."

* "Shut up."

-

"I try to keep my head clear of emotions, and for the past few decades, I have succeeded. He who wants to amount to anything in life must rid himself of all distractions."

* "I agree."

* "I don't care."

* "What are you trying to amount to?"

-

"Nothing less than immortality. Not of myself, mind you. Immortality of civilization, of culture." Darg's dead gaze slowly slides towards the floor but the mouth keeps talking. "What happened to the ancients cannot happen to us. I will make sure of it."

The muscles on Darg's head finally loosen and his tongue touches the ground.

I knee down to inspect the dead body. Surely, the necromancer behind the talking must have used some kind of a device to make the corpse talk. He or she could have implanted it into the windpipe a long ago.

But I find no such thing. Despite my instincts, I must assume that the necromancer is able to do all of this remotely, without the help of any device. I shudder. No human can possibly endure such concentration. Such pain.

On Darg's chest, I find a circular iron badge. It has nothing embossed in it but that simplicity somehow makes it even more impressive. I take it.
