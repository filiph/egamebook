MAP_NAME: Knights Headquarters

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
I come to the headquarters. A large room overlooking the bay. Latrines on the right, hanging out of the window frames, providing fertilizer to the farmer slope below. To the left, as far from the latrines as possible, the bunks where a few of the knights sleep.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE


NOTES:

ACTION: $talk_to_corporal
DESCRIPTION:
The corporal says there's not much the Knights can do. They are retreating in any case. But he does feel responsible. Maybe if I go and help Zee (a knight) with a counter attack, that could give everyone more time to evacuate. I could also help by persuading the Farmers to evacuate. They don't want to.

ACTION: $talk_to_zee -- maybe move Zee to the staging area?
DESCRIPTION:
// Zee wants revenge. His comrade was killed. Zee wants to leave this world with justice served.
The knight called Zee is sitting on a piece of ancient rubble, polishing his sword.

"What can I do for you, friend?"

_"I was told you are planning a counter attack."_

"Yes. That I am."

* _"Where is your unit?"_
* _"That is very brave."_
* _"Good."_

-

<> All I want is justice. And if there is no justice, then what's the point? I don't want to be living in an unjust world. Do you?"

* _"Depends on who the world is unjust_ towards, _no?"_
* _"I don't."_
* _"Doesn't matter what I want. Let's kill some orcs."_

-

The knight nods upwards. "Just let me know. I'll follow you."
