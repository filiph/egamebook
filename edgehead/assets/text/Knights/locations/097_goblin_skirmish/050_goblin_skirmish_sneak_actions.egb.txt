!c.hasHappened(evGoblinCampCleared)

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I gingerly look over the tree stump and see a camp ground with a fire pit and a small shelter made of some animal's hide. There are three goblins, not two. The third goblin is sleeping. There may be more that I don't see, but looking at the size of the camp ground, it's not likely.

This will not be an easy fight if I choose to attack. But [we] do have the element of surprise.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
"Why not go now?" a goblin says in a screeching voice. "They are weak. It will be an easy take."

"How do you know they are weak?" This other goblin's voice is lower. This tells me he is ranked above the first one. "They can have a platoon of guards."

"Amak was there. He saw no guards!" 

"Amak is a fool, and so are you," the higher rank says. "The guards can be in the graytower." He means the Pyramid.

"Another reason why not to go the big building. Let's raid instead!"

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
"The only reason we are here, shithead, is the graytower." This is the lower voice of the higher rank. "Look at the device."

The lower rank starts to growl but apparently thinks better of it. "The come-pass is just a stupid piece of metal. Its maker wants us here, _around_ the graytower. Not _in_ it."

"Oh, you know what the maker wants, do you?"
