ROOM: $gods_lair

FLAGS: $IDLE

POS: 35, 42

FIRST_MAP_NAME: Guard Room
FIRST_HINT: An antechamber to a much bigger room, with a guard post and a huge, reinforced gate.

MAP_NAME: God's Lair
HINT: A temple to the ancients, overtaken by the orcs some time ago. For them, it serves as a pen for a huge creature, Karl.


FIRST_DESCRIPTION: 
Two orcs, a berserker and a captain, watch me approach in amazement.

"You!" the berserker bellows, readying his battle axe. "Stand still so I can chop off your head."

The captain readies a large, bone-decorated knife, and confidently starts towards me.


DESCRIPTION: $NONE

FIGHT_SITUATION:
generateGodsLairFight

AFTER_MONSTERS_CLEARED:
The fight is over. A grumbling from behind the gate. On the gate, a little star decoration.

ROOM: $gods_lair_after_necromancy

VARIANT_OF: $gods_lair

RULE: c.hasHappened(evKarlKilledViaNecromancy)

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
// Note: This is the first time player is in the room (incl. parent), so we know they didn't kill the guards themselves.
The gate is open. On it, there is a small star decoration.

Beyond the gate, a giant's carcass lies. Its belly is teared open from the inside, by a humanoid figure with a bird head. Two dead orcs lie next to a wall.

// TODO: let the player take their weapons
// TODO: optional - one of the orc still lives, easy fight


VARIANT_UPDATE_DESCRIPTION:
The gate is severly damaged. Through a crack, I can see a giant's carcass. Its belly is teared open from the inside, by a humanoid figure with a bird head.

// TODO: allow opening the gate and bringing the taheen with us as a companion.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
The star is small enough to fit into my palm. It says "Lair of God".

TODO: image of a "Lamb of God" christmas star, but the writing is so mangled that it could be mistaken for "Lair of God"

This artifact must be ancient, and of great value to those who revere the old gods.

// TODO: if Aren killed the guards, allow taheen necromancy, and opening the gate

NOTES:

* The sound here is the same guttural growl that the player hears when exploring.
* Allow opening the gate: 
  * If no necromancy was NOT performed, then the giant is sleeping. We can kill it, or go somewhere else. (Later, an event will set Karl loose, and he will decimate the orcs, then fall down from the pyramid.)
  * If necromancy was performed, we can examine the dead giant and the dead taheen.
