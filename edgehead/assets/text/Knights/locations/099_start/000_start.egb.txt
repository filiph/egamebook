I am finally here, in the ancient ruins of San Francisco. I have reached my destination at last. My brother is here, somewhere in this dense forest, among fragments of a long lost civilization.

I am also a necromancer. I can raise the dead, although not very well yet.

// The IF ELSE statement in the following paragraph must build the outputWorld (instead of just using c.playerIsMale) because the custom event for 'player_is_male' was set earlier this action (it's not yet in originalWorld).
I am here with Tamara, the deserter. She is the hired sword for my expedition. It is unwise for a young necromancer to be traveling on [[IF c.outputWorld.build().customHistory.query(name: 'player_is_male').hasHappened]]his[[ELSE]]her[[ENDIF]] own.

Tamara has just finished telling me, for the hundredth time, what a stupid idea it was to come here. I tell her there's nothing to worry about. The tales about goblins and orcs in the forests of San Francisco are exaggerated.

Then of course, a moment later, I'm proven wrong.

![Illustration of a ferocious goblin is stepping out of a bush, holding a sword](goblin.png)

A goblin, bloodlust in his eyes, emerges from his hiding place to stand a few paces in front of us. I look around to see if there are more, but no. He is alone.

* Run ((This is a goblin: a killing machine. No one would fault me for fleeing a fight I will hardly win.))

    Tamara seems pleased with this course of action at first. But the agile goblin runs faster through the overgrowth. [[IF c.playerHasWoodenFoot]]My wooden stump doesn't help.[[ENDIF]] A few heartbeats later, he's almost on us.

    He slashes Tamara's leg and she goes down. There is no more running now. [[IF c.playerHasAsthma]]I wheeze and cough. The damn asthma.[[ENDIF]] But I am able to pick up a solid branch from the ground and I have the initiative now.

    [[CODE]]
    // Make Tamara fall and lose initiative.
    w.updateActorById(
        tamaraId,
        (b) => b
        ..pose = Pose.onGround
        ..initiative = 0
        ..inventory.add(tamarasDagger));
    // TODO: Add the cut to Tamara's anatomy
    // Make goblin also lose initiative.
    w.updateActorById(firstGoblinId, (b) => b.initiative = 10);
    // Give branch to player.
    w.updateActorById(playerId, (b) => b.inventory.equip(startBranch, a.anatomy));
    [[ENDCODE]]

    The goblin growls like a wolf, standing above Tamara. She's had time to draw her battered sword but not much else. The goblin <>

* Attack ((There is no way around this. The goblin is clearly set on fighting us. May as well seize initiative before more of them show up.))

    "I escape war only to be dragged into *this* mess?" Tamara says through gritted teeth. But she moves forward, pointing her battered sword at the goblin. With her off hand, she hands me her dagger. "You'll need it, [young sir]."

    [[CODE]]
    w.updateActorById(playerId, (b) => b.inventory.equip(tamarasDagger, a.anatomy));
    w.updateActorById(firstGoblinId, (b) => b.initiative = 0);
    [[ENDCODE]]

    The goblin is out of the brush and ready to fight. He gnashes his teeth and snarls. He <>

* Wait ((It could be a trap. Or the goblin could decide we are more than he can chew. Either way, a little caution might save our necks.))

    Tamara nods. She points her battered sword at the goblin but doesn't move. "Take my dagger, [young sir]," she says and holds the dagger out toward me, handle-first.

    * * Take the dagger.

        [[CODE]]
        w.updateActorById(playerId, (b) => b.inventory.equip(tamarasDagger, a.anatomy));
        [[ENDCODE]]

        I take the dagger and point it at the goblin. It's surprisingly heavy but well-balanced. 
        
        The goblin attacks. As he runs towards us, he <>

    * * Take a rock from the ground instead.

        [[CODE]]
        w.updateActorById(tamaraId, (b) => b.inventory.add(tamarasDagger));
        w.updateActorById(playerId, (b) => b.inventory.equip(rockFromMeadow, a.anatomy));
        [[ENDCODE]]

        I pick up a mossy rock that sits right next to my {left|right} foot. It's hard and heavy in my palm. As soon as I straighten with the rock in my hand, the goblin attacks. As he runs towards us, he <>

<> aims his rusty sword, grinning.
