ROOM: $smelter


FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
A blast of smoke and heat greets you as you step into the room. A roaring fire draws your attention to the far wall, where thousands of orcs shovel coal into a giant furnace. They tilt huge kettles of molten steel into white-hot flowing rivers. This is the smelter.

[[RULESET]]
[[RULE]]
  $(c).justCameFrom("war_forge")
[[THEN]]
You notice a smooth passage leading up and out of the smelter. You'll be able to go there unnoticed.
[[ENDRULE]]
[[RULE]]
  $(c).justCameFrom("guardpost_above_church")
[[THEN]]
Not far from here there is a short tunnel, sloping down. It leads into the same room where the molten steel ends up — the war forges. You'll be able to go there unnoticed.
[[ENDRULE]]
[[ENDRULESET]]

DESCRIPTION:
The coal reflects the reds and whites of the molten steel.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
Molten iron runs in rivers across the room, and gathers in a large pool. From that pool, a single ogre distributes the forge-ready liquid into troughs that descend to the war forges below. 


The ogre is no more than a spear's throw away from you, but he doesn't notice. In fact, since you’re able to get so close, you would even guess that he's blind, probably because of all the sudden flashes from the molten steel around him. Yet he's performing his job perfectly, listening to commands from orcs in the war forges beyond the wall, and operating the floodgates accordingly.
