FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
The path from slavery to power begins with a single crack of a whip. Briana spins around, her face red with pain and anger. She is new here, but she knows what is coming.


Once Agruth starts whipping, the victim ends up dead. Agruth loves killing slaves.

Another crack and there is new blood pouring from a gash in Briana's face. Agruth grins.


Nobody else is in sight. It's just you, Agruth, and Briana. That's Agruth's first mistake.
