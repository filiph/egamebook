ROOM: $underground_church


FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
You enter a room that at first looks like a large, twisting cave. But then it opens into a high-ceilinged space with many columns. This must be what the orcs call the Underground Church. Dim light shines from the far end of the room, where you’d expect the altar to be, but you can't quite see it. There are no torches here. And it’s eerily quiet. 


Your bare footsteps reverberate in the room, so you slow down to quiet them. 

[[RULESET]]
[[RULE]]
  $(c).justCameFrom("cave_with_agruth")
[[THEN]]
After a bit of searching, you also notice a twisting passage going from the right side of the Church and sloping upward. That must be the way out.

[[ENDRULE]]
[[RULE]]
  $(c).justCameFrom("guardpost_above_church")
[[THEN]]
Not far from here, a tunnel leads slightly downward, back to where you killed Agruth.

DESCRIPTION:
The temple is silent, as if it were holding its breath.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
This place wasn’t built by the orcs or their slaves. The walls are straight and smooth. The ceiling is high enough to make you feel small and insignificant. The columns are decorated with delicate carvings of skulls and tentacles.


"What are these things?" Briana whispers, looking at the ornaments.


_"This place was made for worshiping the Dead Prince."_


Saying the name brings coldness and sweat to your brow. You hear the name every night in the Dead Prince's tongue — but it has been a long time since you said it yourself.


"Worshiping?" Briana glances up at the high ceiling, and then around the temple. "I thought the Dead Prince was a warlord. Something like that."


_"He is a god."_


// Don't allow the following paragraph if we've been through "Wait" in altar - by then Briana is not sceptical

The glow coming from the altar dims for a moment, then lights up again.


_"He is worse than a god. He is fear itself."_


Briana looks at you, narrowing her eyes.


_"I think you have felt it."_
