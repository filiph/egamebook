ROOM: $guardpost_above_church


FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
You enter a small circular room. You see three openings that lead to passages, each marked with crude writing.

- RULESET
- RULE:
  justCameFrom(w, "smelter")
- THEN:
The passage you came from is marked with the words "Hot iron", which must mean "smelter" in the orcs' vocabulary. Another one has the words "Unholy Church" above it. Both of these passages slope downwards.

- END RULE
- RULE:
  justCameFrom(w, "underground_church")

- END RULE
- END RULESET

A third passage is marked "Up Door".  Beyond the opening, you see a steep stairway leading upward. This is it. Your final path to escape.

For the first time, you see a smile on Briana's face. Not a smirk or a battle snarl, but a genuine smile. "_Up Door?_" she whispers, shaking her head. "I can't believe we've made it this far."

Just inside the “Up Door” path sits a goblin guard. You’re in luck: He's sleeping. He loosely holds a scimitar in one hand, and has a shield laid on his lap.
