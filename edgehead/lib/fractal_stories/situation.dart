/// Situation is a phase during play. It governs which actions are available,
/// and what actors can act (and in what order).
///
/// Situations are stacked on a push-down automaton. [Action]s can push new
/// situations on the stack, which are then processed until completion. Actions
/// can also replace the top-most situation with another one, or remove
/// the top-most situation.
///
/// To implement a Situation:
///
/// * Subclass [Situation]. For sake of clarity, we'll call the subclass
///   `MySituation` here.
/// * Put the new class in a separate Dart file.
/// * Make sure that the new class `MySituation` implements
///   `BuiltValue<MySituation, MySituationBuilder>` as required by built_value.
///     * Look at other situations for how that works.
/// * Make sure `pub run build_runner watch` is running. Alternately,
///   run `pub run build_runner build` for a one-time build.
/// * Follow instruction in the newly generated `*.g.dart` file, if any.
